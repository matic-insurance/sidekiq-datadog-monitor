# Sidekiq::Datadog::Monitor

Library that gather sidekiq jobs metrics (currently, only size and latency)
and send it to datadog

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-datadog-monitor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-datadog-monitor

## Usage

To start sending metrics

```ruby
# Import the library
require 'sidekiq/datadog/monitor'

# Initiate a Sidekiq::Datadog::Monitor client instance.
Sidekiq::Datadog::Monitor.initialize!(
  agent_host: 'localhost',
  agent_port: 8125,
  tags: ['env:production', 'product:product_name'], # optional
)
```
 - `agent_host` and `agent_port` instantiate DogStatsD client
 - `tags` additional tags to be added for every metrics

## How it works

Gem using sidekiq lifecycle events to operate and send metrics to datadog. 
Heartbeat event is used to send metrics every 5 seconds. Heartbeat event happens in every sidekiq process so metrics 
will be sent multiple times but will be aggregated on datadog.
