and send it to datadog

## Usage

To start sending metrics

```ruby
# Import the library
require 'sidekiq/datadog/monitor/data'

# Initiate a Sidekiq::Datadog::Monitor client instance.
Sidekiq::Datadog::Monitor::Data.initialize!(
  agent_host: 'localhost',
  agent_port: 8125,
  queue: 'queue name',
  tags: ['env:production', 'product:product_name'], # optional
  cron: "*/30 * * * *" # default: "*/1 * * * *",
  batch: false # optional, default: false
)
```
`agent_host` and `agent_port` instantiate DogStatsD client

`queue` setting for background job that will gather and send Sidekiq metrics

`tags` tags for datadog metrics

`cron` - schedule settings for background job that will gather and send Sidekiq metrics

`batch` turns on sending DD metrics in batches. Make sure you don't have too many queues before enabling this option. The message with all tags must fit into [8KB of default DataDog buffer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/high_throughput/#enable-buffering-on-your-client) size.
